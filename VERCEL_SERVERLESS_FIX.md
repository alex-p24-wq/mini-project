# Vercel Serverless Deployment Fix

## Problem
```
No exports found in module "/var/task/backend/server.js". 
Did you forget to export a function or a server?
```

## Root Cause
Vercel serverless functions require the Express app to be **exported** as a module, but `server.js` was only calling `app.listen()` without exporting the app.

## Solution Applied

### Changes to `backend/server.js`:

1. **Added Database Connection Function** - Reusable connection with caching for serverless
   ```javascript
   let isConnected = false;
   
   const connectDB = async () => {
     if (isConnected) return;
     await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
     isConnected = true;
     // Initialize indexes and email config
   }
   ```

2. **Initialize DB for Serverless** - Auto-connect when module loads
   ```javascript
   connectDB().catch(err => console.error('DB connection error:', err));
   ```

3. **Conditional Server Startup** - Only start HTTP server in non-Vercel environments
   ```javascript
   if (process.env.VERCEL !== '1') {
     startServer();
   }
   ```

4. **Export App** - **CRITICAL FIX** for Vercel
   ```javascript
   export default app;
   ```

## How It Works

### In Vercel (Serverless):
- `VERCEL=1` environment variable is automatically set
- Server doesn't call `app.listen()`
- Vercel imports the exported `app` and handles requests via serverless functions
- Database connection is cached across invocations

### In Traditional Hosting (Render/Local):
- `VERCEL` variable is not set
- Server runs `startServer()` and calls `app.listen()`
- Works like a normal Express server

## Benefits

✅ **Dual Compatibility** - Works on both Vercel serverless AND traditional hosting  
✅ **Connection Pooling** - Reuses MongoDB connections in serverless  
✅ **No Code Duplication** - Single codebase for all platforms  
✅ **Backward Compatible** - Still works locally with `node server.js`  

## Deployment Status

After this fix:
- ✅ Code deploys successfully to Vercel
- ✅ Serverless functions created
- ✅ MongoDB connection established
- ✅ API endpoints accessible

## Testing

Test your backend:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend deployed on Vercel
2. ⏳ Deploy frontend on Render
3. ⏳ Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Vercel environment variables
4. ⏳ Test CORS and API communication

**Important Note:** Vercel serverless has limitations:
- No persistent file storage (uploaded files won't persist)
- 4.5MB request size limit
- 10-second timeout on free tier

For file uploads, consider:
- Using Cloudinary or AWS S3
- OR deploy backend to Render Web Service instead
