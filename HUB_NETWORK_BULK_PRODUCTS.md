## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```javascript
const [hubs, setHubs] = useState([]);              // All hubs
const [bulkProducts, setBulkProducts] = useState([]); // All bulk products
const [selectedDistrict, setSelectedDistrict] = useState(""); // Filter
const [expandedHub, setExpandedHub] = useState(null); // Expansion state
```

### Data Fetching

```javascript
// Fetch hubs
useEffect(() => {
  const response = await getAllHubs();
  setHubs(response);
}, []);

// Fetch bulk products
useEffect(() => {
  const response = await api.get('/hubmanager/bulk-products', {
    params: { limit: 1000 }
  });
  setBulkProducts(response.data.items);
}, []);
```

### Data Grouping

```javascript
// Group hubs by district
const hubsByDistrict = useMemo(() => {
  const grouped = {};
  filteredHubs.forEach(hub => {
    if (!grouped[hub.district]) {
      grouped[hub.district] = [];
    }
    grouped[hub.district].push(hub);
  });
  return grouped;
}, [filteredHubs]);

// Get products for specific hub
const getBulkProductsForHub = (hubName) => {
  return bulkProducts.filter(product => product.nearestHub === hubName);
};

// Get products for specific district
const getBulkProductsForDistrict = (district) => {
  return bulkProducts.filter(product => product.district === district);
};
```

## UI Components

### District Header
- **Background**: Green gradient
- **Info**: Hub count, product count, total value
- **Style**: Modern card with rounded corners

### Hub Card
- **Background**: Light green if has products, gray if none
- **Cursor**: Pointer (clickable)

- **Image**: 140px height, cover fit
- **Hover**: Lift effect with shadow
- **Badges**: Color-coded grade indicators
- **Pricing**: Highlighted price and total value

## Styling Details

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Green**: `#059669` - District headers, prices
- **Light Green**: `#f0fdf4` - Hubs with products
- **Gray**: `#f9fafb` - Hubs without products
- **Yellow**: `#fef3c7` - Total value highlights
- **Blue**: `#e0f2fe` - Filter badges

### Grade Badges
- **Premium**: Yellow background (#fef3c7), Brown text (#92400e) ‚≠ê
- **Organic**: Green background (#d1fae5), Dark green text (#065f46) üåø
- **Regular**: Blue background (#e0e7ff), Dark blue text (#3730a3) üì¶
